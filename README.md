## 📏 Arm Lengths
- First arm: 10 cm
- Second arm: 15 cm
- Third arm: 4 cm

## ⚖️ Load to Lift
- Target weight: 1 kg
- Generated force: weight × gravity = 1 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 9.81 N

## 🧮 Torque Calculation for Each Joint

### 1️⃣ First Joint (BASE)

- Furthest distance: 10 + 15 + 4 = 29 cm (0.29 m)
- Required torque: Torque1 = 9.81 × 0.29 = 2.84 N·m
- Adding 30% safety margin: 2.84 × 1.3 ≈ 3.7 N·m

- 2️⃣ Second Joint (SHOULDER)

- Furthest distance: 15 + 4 = 19 cm (0.19 m)
- Required torque: 9.81 × 0.19 = 1.86 N·m
- Adding 30% safety margin: 1.86 × 1.3 ≈ 2.42 N·m
